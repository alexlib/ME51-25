This GitHub will contain all the code we will mess with in class.

## PIV
To use [open_piv](https://openpiv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), you will need to 
``` py
pip install openpiv
```
To quickly test, run the sample code (called TheirExample.py).

If you want to use the LabVIEW front end, it will allow you to easily build a UI around your python code (much easier than tkinter or pygame).  You will need to get the latest LabVIEW Community Version from [here](https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/software-products/download.labview-community.html?srsltid=AfmBOoqOB9BLQDbdo4P0HVpJtPcjJFU_pPSB6Bp9tKQvbSYrWMcZdUWJ#570612) and the first time you run it, it will ask you where your python is and test to make sure open_piv is installed.  If you do not know where your python is, simply open up Thonny and look at the first line (in grey) in the REPL - it will give you the complete path.
